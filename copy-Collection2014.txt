RE INVENTION.

For AW14/15 Historical and Iconic patterns are re visited, re styled, re coloured, revived and re invented. Essentially classic patterns are re worked to tell a new story.

Heritage checks are given a make over, and are magnified to become unconventionally oversized.
Pinstripes retreat under the surface of the fabric and reveal themselves through a fuzzy surface.
Traditional tartan and plaid designs are re presented as oversized with new and unexpected colourings.
Stripes emerge dramatically from a brushstroke-like ripple surface.
Bold and dramatic colours illuminate engineered panel designs
Plains and semi plains explode with colour, like an artist’s palette, where endless colours can be created with surface mixes that emulate the brush strokes of the artist’s canvas.


COLOUR ME

1.	EXPRESSION Tangeable and Faded Darks

•	As an Expressionist wishes, above all, to express himself, this palette does so too, and creates fabrics and colours that offer a subjective and individual perspective.
•	Rough, tough and emotional dark tones of Jet Black, Dark Navy, Forest Green, Plum and Smoke emphasize extreme emotion. The fabrics become an emotional experience as well as a physical reality.
•	And the powerful tones of Bark, Graphite, Olive and Airforce Blue, although on the surface arbitrary combinations, create powerful and dynamic compositions.
•	Moods and feelings are portrayed with simple colour combinations and harmonies
•	Some darker colours are given a whitening bloom, by brushing, to create a distortion of the expected and to create a “damaged perfection”



2.	IMPRESSION  Soft, Light and Spontaneous

•	A colour story with a fresh and original vision. A lighter and brighter palette, of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour.
•	Progressive colours and fabrics in Dusky Pink, Maize, Verdigris, Lilac and Marine suggest a spirit of independence and rebellion.
•	Short, thick strokes of colour quickly capture the essence of the fabric, rather than its details.
•	Colour marriages such as Brick with Silver, Champagne with Taupe and Coral with Marine give the depiction of light in its changing qualities to create blurred and diffused effects.
•	The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours as the fabric folds and drapes and the darker tones invite closer inspection to reveal a melange of colour.
•	Bold shadows as if painted with the blue of the sky reflected onto the surface, giving a sense of freshness.

3. POP! Bold and Creative colours to elicit an extreme reaction.

•	A palette to challenge traditions , Playful and Arty, as if visually removed from its known context,
•	Colours with a sense of Irony – Aubergine, Ruby Red, Tangerine, Crimson and Mustard
•	Incongruent – mad mixes and wild contrasts teaming Navy with Teal, Taxi Cab Yellow with Tartan Green. Difficult for some to readily comprehend.
•	Minimalism in design, Maximumism in colouring.
•	Hard Edged and Graphic effects, outlined in Black.
•	dramatic styles: romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones created with brushed and fluffy surfaces
•	Tartans re worked with humour, suggesting a certain informalism, playful and punk-like.
•	Wild contrasts
•	Bold colours are applied side-by-side with mixing through brushing, creating a vibrant surface where the optical mixing of colours occurs in the eye of the viewer.
